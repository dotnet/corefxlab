      <summary>The ICMP echo request failed because the destination IP address cannot receive ICMP echo requests or should never appear in the destination address field of any IP datagram. For example, calling <see cref="Overload:System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping.Send" /> and specifying IP address "000.0.0.0" returns this status.</summary>

      <summary>The ICMP echo request failed because the destination computer that is specified in an ICMP echo message is not reachable, because it does not support the packet's protocol. This value applies only to IPv4. This value is described in IETF RFC 1812 as Communication Administratively Prohibited.</summary>

    <member name="F:System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPStatus.DestinationScopeMismatch">
      <summary>The ICMP echo request failed because the source address and destination address that are specified in an ICMP echo message are not in the same scope. This is typically caused by a router forwarding a packet using an interface that is outside the scope of the source address. Address scopes (link-local, site-local, and global scope) determine where on the network an address is valid.</summary>

    <member name="F:System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPStatus.SourceQuench">
      <summary>The ICMP echo request failed because the packet was discarded. This occurs when the source computer's output queue has insufficient storage space, or when packets arrive at the destination too quickly to be processed.</summary>

    </member>
    <member name="F:System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPStatus.TtlReassemblyTimeExceeded">
      <summary>The ICMP echo request failed because the packet was divided into fragments for transmission and all of the fragments were not received within the time allotted for reassembly.
