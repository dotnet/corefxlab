# Work Items

## Span

* [done] Remove Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T> from corefxlab
* [done] Find APIs that we added in `Span<T>` in CoreFxLab we haven't reviewed and/or
  scrutinized.
* [done] Create adaptive package for System.Memory (i.e. fast and slow span)
* [done] support bulk copy
* [done] copyto should work for overlapping ranges
* [done] review SpanExtensions and move some to System.Memory

## Parsing

* [done] remove `EncodingData(byte[][] symbols, TextEncoding encoding,
  Tuple<byte, int>[] parsingTrie)`
* (pri 1) add all primitive parser to PrimitiveParser (e.g. GUID, URI, date
  time, etc.)
* (pri 1) add support for multi-span parsing
