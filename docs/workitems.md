# Work Items

## Span

* [done] Remove Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T> from corefxlab

  scrutinized.
* (pri 0) Create adaptive package for System.Memory (i.e. fast and slow span)
* (pri 0) support bulk copy
* (pri 1) copyto should work for overlapping ranges
* (pri 1) review SpanExtensions and move some to System.Memory

* (pri 1) remove old APIs
* (pri 1) remove `EncodingData(byte[][] symbols, TextEncoding encoding, Tuple<byte, int>[] parsingTrie)`
* (pri 1) add all primitive parser to PrimitiveParser (e.g. GUID, URI, date
  time, etc.)
* (pri 1) add support for multi-span parsing
* (pri 2) support ASCII
* (pri 2) clean up code
* (pri 2) full test coverage
* (pri 2) support all formats
* (pri 2) provide EncodingData.InvariantUtf16BE

## Architecture/Design/Other

* Remove `System.IO.Pipeline.Text.Primitives`
* Prototype `TextReader`-like APIs
* Refactor `System.IO.Pipeline.File` into low level and pipleline-specific APIs
* Refactor `System.IO.Pipeline.Compression` into low level and pipeline-specific APIs
* Design proper Web.Encoding APIs
* Drive language integration for spans
* Write programming guides/docs
* Write solid set of benchmarks
* Explore consumedBytes to be passed by-ref
* Can we return `Span<T>` from `IOutput` (and other APIs)
* Make sure `EndocingData` supports currency and date time formatting
* Decide what to do with Sequences
* How does memory relate to MSR project
* UTF8 string representation
* UTF8 literals

## Other to think about
