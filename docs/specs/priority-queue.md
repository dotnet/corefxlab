# Priority queue proposal

## User data

Before anything is proposed, let's start with what can be prioritized...

### Input types

We want to be able to support all of the following configurations:

1. User data *is separate* from the priority (two physical instances).
2. User data *contains* the priority (as one or more properties).
3. User data *is* the priority (implements `IComparable<T>`).
4. Rare case: priority is obtainable via some other logic (resides in an object different from the user data).

In this entire document, I will refer to the cases above with **(1)**, **(2)**, **(3)**, and **(4)**.

### Ideal solution

Obviously, our solution should be flexible enough to (respectively):

1. Simply accept two separate instances. The user should not be forced to create a wrapper class for the two types only because of our API limitations.
2. Accept an element that already has the priority in it, without duplication (no copying).
3. Be able to use `IComparable<T>` and don't expect an additional priority.
4. Be able to execute some additional logic that retrieves the priority for a given element.

### Our approach

In order to be able to consume all of that, we need two types of priority queues:

* `PriorityQueue<T>`,
* `PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority>`.

## `PriorityQueue<T>`

```csharp
public class PriorityQueue<T> : IQueue<T>
{
    public PriorityQueue();
    public PriorityQueue(IComparer<T> comparer);
    public PriorityQueue(IEnumerable<T> collection);
    public PriorityQueue(IEnumerable<T> collection, IComparer<T> comparer);

    public IComparer<T> Comparer { get; }
    public int Count { get; }

    public bool IsEmpty { get; }
    public void Clear();
    public bool Contains(T element);

    public void Enqueue(T element);

    public T Peek();
    public T Dequeue();
    public bool Remove(T element);

    public bool TryPeek(out T element);
    public bool TryDequeue(out T element);

    public IEnumerator<T> GetEnumerator();
    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator();
  
    public struct Enumerator : IEnumerator<T>
    {
        public T Current { get; }
        object IEnumerator.Current { get; }
        public bool MoveNext() => throw new NotImplementedException();
        public void Reset() => throw new NotImplementedException();
        public void Dispose() => throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

### Scenarios

#### (2)

Custom class with a priority inside:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
	public double Priority { get; }
}
```

The user defines their own comparer, for example:

```csharp
var comparer = Comparer<MyClass>.Create((a, b) =>
{
    return a.Priority.CompareTo(b.Priority);
});
```

And simply uses our priority queue:

```csharp
var queue = new PriorityQueue<MyClass>(comparer);

queue.Enqueue(new MyClass());
```

#### (3)

Already comparable type:

```csharp
public class MyClass : IComparable<MyClass>
{
    public int CompareTo(MyClass other) => /* some logic */
}
```

Then simply call the default constructor (`Comparer<T>.Default` is assumed):

```csharp
var queue = new PriorityQueue<MyClass>();
```

#### (4)

Priority for `MyClass` is obtainable from some other objects, for example a dictionary. It is done analogically to **(2)**, simply by some custom logic in the comparer.

## `PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority>`

```csharp
public class PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority> :
    IEnumerable,
    IEnumerable<(TElement element, TPriority priority)>,
    IReadOnlyCollection<(TElement element, TPriority priority)>
{
    public PriorityQueue();
    public PriorityQueue(IComparer<TPriority> comparer);
    public PriorityQueue(IEnumerable<(TElement, TPriority)> collection);
    public PriorityQueue(IEnumerable<(TElement, TPriority)> collection, IComparer<TPriority> comparer);

    public IComparer<TPriority> Comparer { get; }
    public int Count { get; }

    public bool IsEmpty { get; }
    public void Clear();
    public bool Contains(TElement element);
    public bool Contains(TElement element, out TPriority priority);

    public void Enqueue(TElement element, TPriority priority);

    public (TElement element, TPriority priority) Peek();
    public bool TryPeek(out TElement element, out TPriority priority);
    public bool TryPeek(out TElement element);

    public (TElement element, TPriority priority) Dequeue();
    public bool TryDequeue(out TElement element, out TPriority priority);
    public bool TryDequeue(out TElement element);

    public bool Remove(TElement element);
    public bool Remove(TElement element, out TPriority priority);

    public IEnumerator<(TElement element, TPriority priority)> GetEnumerator();
    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator();

    public IEnumerable<TElement> Elements { get; }
    public IEnumerable<TPriority> Priorities { get; }
      
    public struct Enumerator : IEnumerator<(TElement element, TPriority priority)>
    {
        public (TElement element, TPriority priority) Current { get; }
        object IEnumerator.Current { get; }
        public bool MoveNext() => throw new NotImplementedException();
        public void Reset() => throw new NotImplementedException();
        public void Dispose() => throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

### Scenario

The user has some data and priority separated — **(1)**:

```csharp
var userData = "this is a string";
var priority = 5;
```

So simply:

```csharp
var queue = new PriorityQueue<string, int>();

queue.Enqueue(userData, priority);
```

## Notes

To both priority queues:

* If the `IComparer<T>` is not delivered, `Comparer<T>.Default` is summoned.
* `Peek` and `Dequeue` throw an exception if the collection is empty.
* `TryPeek` and `TryDequeue` only return false.
* `Remove` returns false if the element to remove is not found.
* `Remove` removes only the first occurrence of the specified element.

## `IQueue<T>`

With the design above, we can address some voices regarding the introduction of `IQueue<T>`:

```csharp
public interface IQueue<T> :
    IEnumerable,
    IEnumerable<T>,
    IReadOnlyCollection<T>
{
    int Count { get; }

    void Clear();
    bool IsEmpty { get; }

    void Enqueue(T element);

    T Peek();
    T Dequeue();

    bool TryPeek(out T element);
    bool TryDequeue(out T element);
}
```

### Notes

* Only `PriorityQueue<T>` would implement this interface.
* `IsEmpty` needs to be added to `Queue<T>`.


## Open questions

1. Do we really need `IQueue<T>`?
2. In priority queues, we have `Peek`, and `TryPeek`. There is `Dequeue` and `TryDequeue`. Should there also be `Remove` and `TryRemove` following the same pattern or only `bool Remove(T)` (as it is now)?
3. Do we want to be able to remove and update priorities of elements in O(log n) instead of O(n)? Also, to be able to do conduct such operations on unique nodes (instead of *whichever is found first*)? This would require us to use some sort of a handle:

```csharp
void Enqueue(TElement element, TPriority priority, out object handle);

void Update(object handle, TPriority priority);

void Remove(object handle);
```

4. Do we want to provide an interface for priority queues in the future? If we release two `PriorityQueue` classes, it may be hard to create an interface for them.
5. If we don't want to add the concept of handles in our priority queues, we are basically locking our solution on less efficient and less correct support for updating / removing arbitrary elements from the collection (problem in Java). It is additionally more problematic if we don't add a proper interface. A solution could be to add a proper support for the heaps family (`IHeap` + possibility of various implementations) in `System.Collections.Specialized`.
   * Developers could write their third-party solutions based on a single, standardized interface. Their code can depend on an interface rather than an implementation (`PriorityQueue<T>` or `PriorityQueue<T, U>` — which to choose as an argument?).
   * If such a functionality is added to `CoreFXExtensions`, there would be no common ground for third-party libraries.
   * Decision where this would eventually land (`CoreFX` or not) directly impacts whether missing features in our support for priority queues are an issue or not. If we add heaps to `System.Collections.Specialized`, priority queues can be lacking more power and enhanceability. If we don't, there is an issue.
