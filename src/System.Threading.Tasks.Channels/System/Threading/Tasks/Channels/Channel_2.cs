        // TODO: Determine if we want this support on Channel<TWrite, TRead> or not.
        // Pro:
        // - Makes it easier to consume a channel, being able to write "c.Blah" instead of "c.Out.Blah" or "c.In.Blah"
        // Con:
        // - Most usage of a channel doesn't need both sides of it, so the code can be written in terms of either
        //   side, and the extra .Out / .In won't be needed on each usage
        // - These all involve an extra virtual call, first using Out/In, and then making the appropriate virtual
        //   call on those.  That could be addressed by making all of these virtual, in which case the derived
        //   type could override them all to avoid the extra virtual hop, but then that's a bunch of extra
        //   code to override all of these members multiple times.
        // - Either every additional member on one of the halfs needs to be duplicated here, or we have a
        //   potential inconsistency with some operations showing up on the halfs but not on the whole.
